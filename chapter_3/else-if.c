/***
 * - To illustrate a three-way decision, here is a binary search function that
 *   decides if a particular value x occurs in the sortey array v. The elements
 *   of v must be in increasing order.
 *
 * - The function returns the position (a number between 0 and n-1) if x occurs
 *   in v, and -1 if not.
 *
 * - Binary search first compares the input value x to the middle element of the
 *   array v. If x is less than the middle value, searching focuses on the lower
 *   half of the table, otherwise on the upper half. In either case, the next
 *   step is to compare x to the middle element of the selected half. This
 *   process of dividing the range in two continues until the value is found or
 *   the range is empty.
