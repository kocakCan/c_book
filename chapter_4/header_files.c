/***
 * 4.5 Header Files
 *
 * Let us now consider dividing the calculator program into several source
 * files, as it might be each of the components were substantially bigger. The
 * main function would go in one file, which we will call main.c; push, pop, and
 * their variables go into a second file, stack.c; getop goes into a third,
 * getop.c. Finally, getch and ungetch go into a fourth file, getch.c; we
 * seperate them from the others because they would come from a
 * seperately-compiled library in a realistic program.
 *
 * TODO: Continue from this point
